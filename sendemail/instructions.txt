1. Created a Custom User model which inherits AbstractUser

2.. Created a CustomUser Manger model 
3. created the registration form 
4. Created sign_up view (here a next parameter is introduced) 

--- To send a verification mail, 4 views are used here. Though I didn't need the last view here as it was causing errors.

1. verify_email: Sends the link to user's verify_email
2. verify_email_done: Tells the user to check email 
3. verify_email_confirmed: verifies the link from backend
4. verify_email_complete: redirects user

to actually show the message to the user- 

{% if messages %}
  <ul class="messages">
    {% for message in messages %}
      <li class="{{ message.tags }}">{{ message }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
{% endif %}
